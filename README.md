# SpaceInvaders
C++ Example of Space Invaders Clone

## Source
This clone came from this 5 part [tutorial](https://nicktasios.nl/posts/space-invaders-from-scratch-part-1.html) on creating a Space Invaders clone with C++

I have deviated from the tutorial to match newer versions of C++

## Running
To build and run the app just use the run bash script. It will automatically build and run the application
```bash
./run.sh
```

## Playing
At the moment all you can do is destroy the aliens.
* Left/Right arrow keys for movement
* Space to shoot
* ESC to close the game
